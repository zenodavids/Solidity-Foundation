<!-- EVERYTHING IS A NUMBER -->

- computers only work with numbers
- hardware deals with bits(zero[0] and ones[1])
- abstraction is knowing what needs to be known[this is the separation from interface vs implementation].
- use the ASCII Table to know the numerical value of a character.

==> importance of everything is a number

- can expose numeric properties;
  cryptography( the science of keeping information secured) relies on the ability to do maths on strings.

- Types; interpretation of numbers; type of data tell what the numbers mean and not how to operate on them.

- Representing data as numbers

==> Programs are also numbers

- starts out as a string,
- another program takes this string and turns into instructions that are numerical encoding of what to do.

<!-- COLORS ARE NUMBERS -->
if we add two color shades to get another color with RGB(RED, BLUE, GREEN). ie;

            RGB(RED, BLUE, GREEN)
purple          255   0     255
lemon green   +  0   255     0
            _____________________
             =  255  255    255     which gives us white
